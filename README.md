# float

a simple dice roller bot made for me and my friends. hosted under MIT license.

mostly on maintenance because there's not much stuff you can put in a diceroller bot.

## how do i host this

1. install `docker`, `docker-compose` and git by extension
2. clone this repo with git
3. `docker-compose build`
4. `docker run -e TOKEN=<DISCORD_TOKEN> -d float_bot`
5. `history -c` to clear your history so that the token is hidden
